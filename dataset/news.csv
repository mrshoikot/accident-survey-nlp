https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/road-accident-cases-in-bangladesh-conviction-only-5pc-cases-1749403,"May 27, 2019",Road Accident Cases: Conviction in only 5pc cases,"Hours after Ataul Islam was crushed under the wheels of a bus on October 12 last year, his family filed a murder case against the driver hoping to get justice.
But Sub-inspector Riazul Islam got in the way.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
Soon after getting the charge of investigation, he arranged a meeting with the victim’s family and the bus owner. Riazul subsequently forced the family to strike a deal with the bus owner to withdraw the case and go home with some money instead, alleged Shamim, the victim’s brother-in-law who filed the case with Pallabi police in the capital.
The police official brokered the deal even though the case was filed under two particular sections of the penal code that do not allow such out-of-court settlements. In court language, these cases are called non-compoundable.
The case was filed under section 279, which deals with rash driving, and 304 (B) that deals with causing death by rash or negligent driving, both considered serious crimes.
Even so, after five months of “investigation,” the IO submitted the final report along with a letter of set-tlement from the victim’s family in March this year. He also appealed to the court for the driver’s acquit-tal, showing him absconding.
But the court quickly spotted the violation of the law and rejected his report. It also instructed the Police Bureau of Investigation to take over the probe.   
In its observation, the court rebuked the IO for submitting the final report. “Investigation officers should demonstrate professional skills and act only in line with the law.”
The PBI has since reopened the investigation and arrested Md Jashim, the driver of the Achim Paribahan bus that killed Ataul, a garment worker, when he was crossing the road in Pallabi area.
Not all families are as lucky, however. Police and court sources said most road accident cases are set-tled outside the court, with police officers acting as middlemen.
A senior official at the Police Headquarters said only 4-5 percent road accident cases see conviction per year.
Last year, 2,609 accident cases were filed across the country, up from 2,562 the previous year.
Metropolitan Public Prosecutor Abdullah Abu said a large number of accident cases do not even reach the court.
“They are settled outside the court, resulting in a poor conviction rate. In other cases, the accused get acquitted because of faulty investigations,” he told The Daily Star last week.
TK 70,000 FOR A LIFE?
In Ataul’s case, bus owner Shukkur Mohamamd Khokon and his associates met Shamim, the complainant, after he filed the case. They then asked him to settle the matter in presence of police, said Md Ibrahim, a neighbour who was present at the time.
Inside the police station, the IO and the bus owner threatened him with consequences if he did not reach a compromise, said Sheikh Mohammad Alam, another neighbour present during the negotiation.
Pressured, Shamim said he would settle for Tk 5 lakh. But the bus owner boasted he could secure bail for the driver for only Tk 5,000 and offered Shamim Tk 50,000, witnesses said.
The IO intervened, and offered Tk 70,000 on behalf of the bus owner and compelled him to take the deal, said Rashida Begum, Ataul’s widow.
Rights activist Nur Khan Liton said such settlements in road accident cases had become very common as police did not act properly.
“Besides, the lengthy investigation process often renders victims and their families helpless. So they reach a compromise to get some financial benefit,” he added.
Asked, Sohel Rana, assistant inspector general (media) at the PHQ, said they instructed investigating officers to attach special importance to accident cases. “They are now more careful when dealing with accident cases.”
‘DID NOTHING, KNEW  NOTHING’
Bus driver Jashim is now in jail and the PBI is planning to submit the charge sheet in a month, but the police took no action against SI Riazul.
Contacted, he said he had nothing to do with the settlement.
“The complainant reached a compromise with the bus owner. Why would the police be involved in this when they have no benefit out of this?” said Riazul, still posted in Pallabi.
He kept mum when asked why he submitted a letter of compromise in a case filed under non-compoundable section.
Nazrul Islam, officer-in-charge of Pallabi Police Station, said he was yet to receive the court order, although the PBI received the same order on March 27, two days after the court issued it.
“We will definitely take necessary initiative after receiving the court order,” he added.
The Daily Star called the bus owner at least 30 times over the last one week, but he did not pick up the call. This paper also visited the Paribahan’s bus counter, but its employees declined to comment.",Dailystar,1,,,Bus,

In the capital, Uttam Kumar Sarkar, SI of Rupnagar Police Station, was tasked with bringing the bus of Eagle Paribahan to the police station from Mirpur Beribadh area.  
The Barisal-bound bus was seized four days ago after its brake failed and hit the jeep of a Jahangirnagar University teacher near Birulia in Mirpur area. It was kept there since then.
Around 4:00pm yesterday, the police official, who was riding a motorbike, asked an Eagle Paribahan staffer to drive the bus and follow him to the police station.
When Uttam slowed his motorcycle at a speed breaker at Mirpur's Rainkhola, the bus's brake failed again and the vehicle rammed his motorcycle.
He got tossed onto the road and the bike went under the bus. The vehicle drove over his body and stopped after running a few yards, according to the statement of a case filed by Uttam's brother Dipankar Sarkar last night.
The SI died on the spot, said police and witnesses. 
Police arrested the bus driver, Belal Hossain, 38, who was accused in the case.    
Asked why a wrecker was not used, SM Shah Alam, officer-in-charge of Rupnagar Police Station, said the SI had been asked to bring the bus, using a wrecker.

According to a recent report of Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, at least 259 people were killed and 960 injured in 237 road accidents from August 16 to 28, when the transport sector saw a huge rush of passengers due to the Eid vacation.
The report, released by the passenger welfare platform at a press conference on Friday, pointed out that the accidents took place despite the measures taken by the authorities to ensure road safety following the recent student demonstration for safe roads.

https://www.thedailystar.net/news/frontpage/road-safety-demo-not-much-has-changed-those-2-deaths-1626001,"Aug 29, 2018",Month Since July 29 Deaths: Roads not any safer,"It has been exactly a month since two college students were squashed to death by a bus on the Airport Road that sparked an unprecedented movement by students to demand road safety.
The memories of the tumultuous days have hardly waned and the roads have returned to their old self -- unfit buses still plying, drivers sitting behind steering wheels without licence, and more than 300 road deaths have been added to the total tally in the last one month.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
One of the major reasons for the anarchy on the roads is that the drivers run the buses by paying a certain amount to the owners and so they race through the roads to make as many trips as possible, stopping anywhere on the road to pick that extra passengers. This has not changed although the bus owners made a false promise that they would scrap the system and give appointment letters to the drivers and helpers.
Some things have changed though -- the amount of illegal payment for getting fitness certificates for vehicles. A Dhaka car owner who did not want to be named said she had to pay Tk 5,000 this time, instead of the previous year's Tk 1,500, to get the fitness certificate. The inspectors said her car's tyre size was different from what was mentioned in the papers and that it had a dent on the rear dampener.  
The other change that has come is the cabinet's approval of the draft Road Transport Act 2018 -- something touted by the government as a big deal which it is not since there is no dearth of existing laws to check errant drivers and vehicles. What was lacking is the truthful application of the rules and laws.
The Road Transport Advisory Council headed by the road transport minister held its first meeting after ten months and came up with the age-old decision of stopping low-speed vehicles on highways.
That decision again proved to be on papers as in the past nine days (August 20 to 28) at least 10 accidents happened on highways involving slow vehicles, killing at least 46 people and injuring more than 40 (according to The Daily Star tally alone).
But what has not happened is what many thought the government would do -- form a high-powered taskforce comprising accident experts and examine the root causes for accidents and then set priority to fix the problems.
The adhocism and face-saving measures that the authorities are taking as eyewash can be found in the action of the police on the Natore highway where 15 passengers of a low-speed vehicle died three days ago. Soon after the accident, police forced all such vehicles off that highway.
Elsewhere in the country, these accident-prone transports ply as freely as before.
Apparently disappointed over the failure of the road transport and bridges ministry to ensure road safety and bring discipline in the transport sector, the Prime Minister's Office itself got involved in the process. It has already given directives thrice and formed a high-powered committee headed by PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hassan to monitor implementation of various government measures to ensure road safety.
But even in this volatile situation, transport owners and workers -- very powerful elements in the transport sector often backed by two ministers -- are doing everything to protect their interests. On the pretext of shortage of drivers, they forced the government to relax until December 31 the requirement of experience for getting licences to drive medium and heavy vehicles. This will make the road risker.
According to the National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways, at least 315 people -- 282 men, 39 women and 54 children -- lost their lives in 282 road accidents across the country between July 29 and August 27. At least 819 more were injured.
The non-government platform, which campaigns for transport safety, compiled the data from 22 national dailies, 10 regional dailies and eight news portals and agencies.  
But whatever little changes are happening, it is because of the student protesters, said one BRTA official.
“They gave us a jolt, which was necessary. Now, let's see what happens in the coming days,” he added, asking not to be named.  
Jahangir Fakir, father of Dia Khanam Mim, one of the two college students killed in the July 29 road crash, said it was heartening to see that the government was taking some initiatives, including the drive against unfit vehicles.
“I hope that the government will not go soft. People have started to obey traffic rules, at least to some extent. However, it will take time and I hope discipline will be restored on the road,” he told The Daily Star last night. 
“I want roads to be safe, even if it comes at the cost of my daughter's life,” said Jahangir, himself a bus driver for about 30 years.",Dailystar,2,,on the airport road,bus,

On April 3, Rajib was going to attend his classes by a double-decker bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BTRC). He was standing on the rear gate dangling his right hand outside as the bus was overcrowded.
When the bus got stranded at the Sonargaon crossing near Panthakunja Park, a 'Sajan Paribahan' bus tried to make its way through the narrow space on between the BRTC bus and the footpath. However, Rajib's right hand was pressed in between the two buses and got severed from the elbow.
The organisation came up with an eight-point demand at the press conference, which are:
1. The killers of Rajib should be given capital punishment. A law should be formulated keeping the provision of death for all road accidents.
2. To control over traffic jam and prevent road accidents and to ensure proper passengers service through stopping getting on and off a vehicle indiscriminate.
3. Implement the government-fixed rate of transport fare including 50% fare cut for students in city and intercity public transports. Students should get a 25% fare cut in long route transports.
4. Steps should be taken against ""sitting service"" buses which run under various names.
5. There should be a balance in public transport fare. All vehicles should keep the fare chart and those who collect excessive fare should be punished.
6. BRTA must conduct effective drives on a regular basis to stop anarchy in the public transports. Security for women should be ensured and if any woman gets harassed, punitive action should be taken against the culprits.
7. AC and non-AC bus services should be launched to reduce pressure of private transports.
8. People who suffered in road accidents should be brought under an insurance policy.
