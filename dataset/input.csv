In a press release, the NCPSRR said it got the figures after monitoring reports of 22 national dailies, 10 regional newspapers, and eight online news portals and news agencies.
NCPSRR General Secretary Ashis Kumar Dey in the release said they had identified 10 major reasons behind the rampant accidents.
The reasons include unhealthy competition among drivers, reckless driving, drivers and helpers running buses on contract, employing drivers without proper or no licence, lack of pedestrians’ awareness, and overloading and illegally overtaking.
Besides, driving for a long time without breaks, poor law enforcement regarding unfit vehicles, violation of traffic rules, increase in motorcycles and three-wheelers numbers on roads and highways, and carrying of passengers and goods in locally made motorised vehicles were also mentioned.
In Sirajganj yesterday, nine people were killed and three others injured as a bus heading for Pabna carrying homegoers collided head-on with a human haulier, locally known as laguna, in Boalia Bridge area under Ullapara upazila around 1:00pm.
The human haulier was on the wrong side of the road when the bus hit it at speed, said Dewan Kawshik Ahmed, officer-in-charge of Ullapara Police Station.
The human haulier fell into a roadside ditch. Eight of its passengers died on the spot and another one on the way to Sirajganj General Hospital, said the police official.
Eight of the dead were identified as Nur Islam, 45, Md Akhter, 42, Rezaul Karim, 35, Abdul Mannan, 45, Md Ali, 25, Sabuj, aged around 35, Joynuddin, 42, and Ahmadul, 22, of Ullapara upazila. The identity of the other could not be known im-mediately.
The injured were undergoing treatment at different hospitals, the OC added.
In Sunamganj, seven people were killed and five others wounded as a bus heading for Dhaka crashed into a laguna in Ganiganj area of Dakshin Sunamganj upazila early yesterday.
All the dead were laguna passengers. Six died on the scene while another died on the way to Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, said Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, OC of Dakshin Sunamganj Police Station.
The dead were human haulier driver Noman Miah, 24, Sagar Ahmed, 15, Milon Miah, 16, Afzal Miah, 17, Rimendra Chandra Das, 22, Fazlul Karim, 30, and Shipon Kumar Saha, 33.
After the head-on collision, both the vehicles plunged into a roadside ditch, said the OC.
Newton Das Talukder, a local fire service official, said, “We think both the vehicles were running at high speed and drivers were probably feeling drowsy. These two factors might cause the accident.”
In Gazipur, two siblings died when their motorcycle hit a roadside tree in Tetulia Bypass area under Kapasia upazila. The rider was trying to let a bus overtake them.
The victims were Sobhan, 45, and Khorsed Alam, 30, of Phulbaria village in the upazila.
Quoting witnesses, victims’ father Abdur Rashid said the two went for Eid shopping at Kapasia Bazar. When they were returning home, their motorbike hit a roadside tree.
Both were critically wounded and they were rushed to Kapasia Upazila Health Complex where on-duty doctors declared them dead, he added.
In Natore, eight-year-old girl Mariya Tasnim, daughter of Abdul Jalil, died on the spot and four members of her family sustained injuries when a microbus carrying them hit a roadside tree at Mohisbhanga in Baraigram upazila around 11:00am yesterday.

But Sub-inspector Riazul Islam got in the way.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
Soon after getting the charge of investigation, he arranged a meeting with the victim’s family and the bus owner. Riazul subsequently forced the family to strike a deal with the bus owner to withdraw the case and go home with some money instead, alleged Shamim, the victim’s brother-in-law who filed the case with Pallabi police in the capital.
The police official brokered the deal even though the case was filed under two particular sections of the penal code that do not allow such out-of-court settlements. In court language, these cases are called non-compoundable.
The case was filed under section 279, which deals with rash driving, and 304 (B) that deals with causing death by rash or negligent driving, both considered serious crimes.
Even so, after five months of “investigation,” the IO submitted the final report along with a letter of set-tlement from the victim’s family in March this year. He also appealed to the court for the driver’s acquit-tal, showing him absconding.
But the court quickly spotted the violation of the law and rejected his report. It also instructed the Police Bureau of Investigation to take over the probe.   
In its observation, the court rebuked the IO for submitting the final report. “Investigation officers should demonstrate professional skills and act only in line with the law.”
The PBI has since reopened the investigation and arrested Md Jashim, the driver of the Achim Paribahan bus that killed Ataul, a garment worker, when he was crossing the road in Pallabi area.
Not all families are as lucky, however. Police and court sources said most road accident cases are set-tled outside the court, with police officers acting as middlemen.
A senior official at the Police Headquarters said only 4-5 percent road accident cases see conviction per year.
Last year, 2,609 accident cases were filed across the country, up from 2,562 the previous year.
Metropolitan Public Prosecutor Abdullah Abu said a large number of accident cases do not even reach the court.
“They are settled outside the court, resulting in a poor conviction rate. In other cases, the accused get acquitted because of faulty investigations,” he told The Daily Star last week.
TK 70,000 FOR A LIFE?
In Ataul’s case, bus owner Shukkur Mohamamd Khokon and his associates met Shamim, the complainant, after he filed the case. They then asked him to settle the matter in presence of police, said Md Ibrahim, a neighbour who was present at the time.
Inside the police station, the IO and the bus owner threatened him with consequences if he did not reach a compromise, said Sheikh Mohammad Alam, another neighbour present during the negotiation.
Pressured, Shamim said he would settle for Tk 5 lakh. But the bus owner boasted he could secure bail for the driver for only Tk 5,000 and offered Shamim Tk 50,000, witnesses said.
The IO intervened, and offered Tk 70,000 on behalf of the bus owner and compelled him to take the deal, said Rashida Begum, Ataul’s widow.
Rights activist Nur Khan Liton said such settlements in road accident cases had become very common as police did not act properly.
“Besides, the lengthy investigation process often renders victims and their families helpless. So they reach a compromise to get some financial benefit,” he added.
Asked, Sohel Rana, assistant inspector general (media) at the PHQ, said they instructed investigating officers to attach special importance to accident cases. “They are now more careful when dealing with accident cases.”
‘DID NOTHING, KNEW  NOTHING’
Bus driver Jashim is now in jail and the PBI is planning to submit the charge sheet in a month, but the police took no action against SI Riazul.
Contacted, he said he had nothing to do with the settlement.
“The complainant reached a compromise with the bus owner. Why would the police be involved in this when they have no benefit out of this?” said Riazul, still posted in Pallabi.
He kept mum when asked why he submitted a letter of compromise in a case filed under non-compoundable section.
Nazrul Islam, officer-in-charge of Pallabi Police Station, said he was yet to receive the court order, although the PBI received the same order on March 27, two days after the court issued it.
“We will definitely take necessary initiative after receiving the court order,” he added.
The Daily Star called the bus owner at least 30 times over the last one week, but he did not pick up the call. This paper also visited the Paribahan’s bus counter, but its employees declined to comment.",Dailystar

She was on track to be an engineer and make her family’s dream come true. But her life was cut short by a road crash yesterday.
Fahmida Haque Labannya, 21, a third-year student of computer science and engineering department at Brac University, was killed after a pickup hit the motorcycle she was riding on from behind and ran over her, witnesses said.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
The incident took place in front of National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area around 11:15am while she was on the way to her university as the pillion passenger of a motorbike hired from the ride-sharing platform Uber.
Police identified the driver as one Suman, 23, who also got hurt in the incident and took primary treatment at the emergency section of nearby Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital. But police could not find him there as he left the hospital before they arrived.
The tragic accident left the family in shock. Farhanul Haque Mridul, younger brother of Fahmida, said her sister left their Shyamoli residence around 10:30am.
“She had a dream. She was going to be a computer engineer soon,” said the lamenting mother of Fahmida.
Sohel Rana, an eyewitness of the incident, said the bike was on the middle of the street around 11:15am when a lorry hit the motorcycle.
 “No sooner had the girl fell on the road than the speedy vehicle ran over her head while fleeing the scene,” Sohel told The Daily Star.
Sub-Inspector Nurul Islam said he checked the footage of the CCTV cameras installed nearby but they did not cover the accident spot.
Nurul took the phone number of Suman from the hospital’s register. But his mobile phone was found switched off.
SI Nurul said the ride-sharing companies were providing passengers’ helmets only for the sake of traffic rules and to dodge the eyes of the law enforcers.
“The girl was wearing a helmet, but it was too thin to protect her,” the police officer said.
Jane Alam Munshi, officer-in-charge of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police Station, said police were trying to track the motorcyclist to know the details about the incident.
Hearing the news, many of her friends and university mates gathered at the hospital premises and asked how the roads would be made safer for commuters when deaths on road is unstoppable.
“Every time a young life is cut short, we start protesting. Is this how the things will go on?” asked a Brac University student.
The victim’s family demanded exemplary punishment of those involved in the incident.
The accident took place barely a month into the killing of university student Abrar Ahmed in a road crash that triggered massive protests over unsafe roads and poor traffic management.

https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/perspective/news/the-dos-and-donts-handling-emergency-situations-1727551,"Apr 10, 2019",The dos and don'ts of handling emergency situations,"Over the past two decades of working in the risk-consulting business, two things have become apparent to me: (i) after every major incident, we suddenly become very worried and conscious about lack of safety, and (ii) we forget all about our worries in about a week. In the meantime, lives and livelihoods of several families are permanently altered because of the incident—all in haste.
How we behave during and after an incident is correlated with the number of lives saved or lost. When a serious incident occurs, whether a road accident or a building fire, hundreds of people flock to the spot. Soon the roads get blocked. People begin to talk about it on social media. Mainstream media quickly picks up the news. By the end of it, there is absolute panic with little reliable information on the incident.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
There has been much discussion about the lives saved in the fire at Banani's FR Tower because of the actions of daring heroes who risked their own lives to save others (we saw this during Rana Plaza too). Yes, several lives were saved, thanks to some people's heroic efforts.
However, let's not forget that roads were totally blocked all the way up to FR Tower by thousands of onlookers, which prevented fire trucks and emergency services from reaching the site quicker. Thus the question that should also be asked is: how many lives were lost due to roads being blocked?
Dhaka is severely congested. But carefully devised roles played out by the police, fire department, and emergency medical services can save critical time and lives. The government is working on developing an emergency response plan. But implementation, investment, and training will take time. In the meantime, the following strategy may be put in place as a response to any emergency.
  Role of the police
Once confirmed information is received by the police, they may inform the local electric supply authority to cut off electrical power, and begin the process of clearing people from the area. This is to ensure clear passage of the various other emergency services, and for the safety of the general public (boilers, chemicals, and transformers may explode, glass may shatter). The police are well-versed in clearing roads, thanks to the movement of high-profile VIPs around the city. The entire route from the fire station to the site of the emergency is to be cleared for smooth passage. A yellow-tape barrier will keep the public at bay. Onlookers and those willing to help should be restricted from breaking through the barrier until and unless their voluntary services are requested. It is important to note that public emotions run high during such emergencies. The police needs to remain calm, be sympathetic but firm, and hold down the fort during this period.
  Role of fire services
It is important that fire services are in constant communication with the police who can feed them information which will allow the fire services to decide whether to send ladders or long-range crane fire trucks, safety nets, inflatable cushions, and water or other suppression agents to the site. Fire service authorities need to ask a few basic questions to the police: (i) what is the emergency (fire, building collapse, accident, etc.)?; (ii) what is the occupancy (office, residence, factory, warehouse, etc.) type?; (iii) what is the height of the building?; and (iv) what is the estimated number of lives at risk? Fire trucks can be dispatched from various locations based on this information. It is imperative that the first responders are also the right responders (take the FR Tower incident as an example). This is achievable if the right information is communicated to the fire services in the first instance.
  Role of emergency medical services
Throughout the world, fire services are typically dispatched together with emergency medical providers to the same location. With the right information, medical services can also help estimate the total number of ambulances and personnel required to be dispatched.
  Role of civilian onlookers
The advice from emergency experts is to ""stay away"". Give space to the authorities to do their job. If you wish to volunteer, let the police know you are standby to assist. If the fire service authorities require volunteers, the police will then draw a specific number of volunteers to assist the fire brigade. Till then, wait and remain calm. Once again, taking the FR Tower incident as an example, the first few ambulances arrived approximately at 1:45pm; however, many could not reach the site as the entire road was blocked by onlookers.
  Role of media
An emergency situation is already (negatively) sensational. There is no need to further sensationalise it. All that it does is create unnecessary panic and desperation. Don't speculate. Report what is known to be accurate. Inaccurate information wastes time as it diverts resources.
  Need for change
One thing that must change is the way the authorities communicate with the public during ongoing emergencies. And currently, there is an absence of communication. During the course of an emergency, a designated official from the nearby police station should take charge and draw the public and media to a nearby location to give updates at every 30-minute interval. S/he will update them on the actions being taken by the authorities. By not taking control of the communication process, the authorities allow the public and the media to draw their own conclusions. Don't prevent the media from doing their job, but work with them.
The above formula can be replicated for any emergency situation.
The government needs to lead by example. Government establishments should be the role model for non-public entities. How many government schools, colonies, offices, and hospitals are equipped with fire hydrants, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, alternate emergency exits and fire escapes, fire plans, emergency response plans, or fire-rated doors? The answer is, very few, if not none. This leads to claims of double standards and generates mistrust among the general public. The government should lead the way by setting an example of minimum standards, not just for building construction, but also for public safety. People also need to start demanding safer workplaces and facilities from their employers.
How many fires or Rana Plazas will it take till we wake up to the alarming reality of the near non-existence of safety standards that we are living with?

https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/bus-race-costs-another-life-1725673,"Apr 6, 2019",Bus race costs another life,"Yet another ugly race between two buses took away the life of a college student at Mostafa Majir intersection of Rampura-Demra Road in the capital yesterday, sparking protests in the area.
Iram Bepari, 19, a first-year student of Golam Mostafa Model College in Demra, was hit by one of the speeding buses around 11:00am, killing him on the spot. He was on a bicycle.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
The accident took place barely three weeks into university student Abrar Ahmed's killing in a road crash that triggered massive protests over unsafe roads and poor traffic management.
Iram's death coincided with separate road accidents that left at least nine people killed and 16 injured across the country yesterday.
The college student used to live with his parents at Amulia Purbapara in Demra. He had come to play cricket on a field near the Mostafa Majhir intersection, said his cousin Masudur Rahman Masud.
In the middle of the game, Iram took a friend's bicycle and headed for the bazaar on the intersection to have some water.   
Witnesses said two buses of Ramzan Paribahan and Swadhin Paribahan were racing towards Rampura at that time. The bus of Ramzan Paribahan hit Iram's bicycle and dragged him around 10 yards, they added.
""When the buses were trying to overtake each other, one made room for the bicycle while another knocked it down,” said Harez Mia, a witness.
In protest, fellow students and locals blocked the intersection after Juma prayers for two and a half hours. They put up barricades on the road with burning tyres, halting vehicular movement.
Around 15 vehicles were vandalised during the road blockade while the agitating people demanded justice for recent road accidents and construction of foot bridges and speed breakers in the area.
The blockade was removed around 4:30pm after the police high-ups assured the protesters of action. After the accident, authorities were seen constructing a speed breaker on the spot.
Earlier on July 29 last year, two college students were killed during a race between two buses in Shewra area on Airport Road in the capital, touching off a wave of protests actively participated by students of almost all educational institutions. The agitations lasted for more than a week and put Dhaka on a standstill.

ANGER, FRUSTRATION
Iram's father Delwar Hossain expressed frustration over the spate of road accidents cutting the young lives short.
""What will happen if I file a case? There would be no action and such accidents will continue…” said Delwar, a ready-made garment trader in Dhaka's New Market area.
One of the protesters said, “Whenever a road accident happens or someone is killed, a footbridge or speed breaker is constructed. Is this how we want to ensure road safety?”
The relatives of Iram want stern punishment of people responsible for his untimely death.
Iram's cousin Masudur Rahman said their another cousin Imran, 28, lost his life under the wheels of a speeding bus at the same place, just three months back.
Khokon Mia, a vendor, said Iram's body was lying on the road for an hour when a patrol team of Khilgaon police was seen nearby. When locals told them to take the body to hospital, they said the area was under Demra police and they had nothing to do about it.
Police said they seized the bus of Ramzan Paribahan and also detained its driver and helper.

Survivors of the deadly smash told rescuers the driver of one of the buses had been feeling sleepy before the crash but refused to take a break.
They said they shattered the vehicle's windows and escaped with just seconds to spare before flames took hold with other passengers still inside.
The accident happened at about 2:00am (0200 GMT) in the Bono East region, some 430 kilometres (270 miles) by road north of the capital, Accra.
""The vehicles were travelling in separate directions when the collision occurred,"" police commander Joseph Antwi Gyawu told AFP.
""At least 60 people have been confirmed dead and one of the buses caught fire, with the other seriously mangled,"" he added.
The buses were each carrying about 50 passengers at the time of the crash. One of the buses caught fire, leaving victims burned beyond recognition.
Emergency services were at the scene, including firefighters who put out the blazing vehicles, which were still smouldering hours after the crash.
Video footage of the crash site indicated that one of the buses was completely gutted. The road was strewn with debris over several hundred metres.
Bags and belongings of passengers from the second bus were in piles on the roadside. The side of the vehicle, which was at an angle into the embankment, appeared ripped off.
Kwame Arhin, a doctor at the Kintampo Government Hospital, said 28 people were being treated for head injuries and multiple fractures.
""Seven out of the 28 passengers who were rushed here are in critical condition,"" he added.
Ghana's Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia said action was required to prevent such accidents.
""As a country we need to put in place appropriate measures to drastically reduce the occurrence of such mishaps,"" he wrote on his Twitter account.
""We wish the injured speedy recovery and may the souls of the departed rest in perfect peace.""
Road safety fears 
The cause of the crash was yet to be established but local media said a driver of one of the vehicles lost control after falling asleep.
""Some of the survivors are telling us that their driver was feeling sleepy at some point during that time of the night so he was asked to park but he refused,"" Kintampo fire service commander Ankomah Twene told local station TV3.
""We believe it contributed to the accident,"" he added.
A survivor, Rose Anane, said: ""I was fast asleep then I heard a loud bang. We managed to break the glass and it was just a few of us -- about 10 -- who managed to move out. 
""In a matter of seconds then the vehicle went on fire with the others still trapped in the car. We watched on as the fire consumed them. It was late into the night.""
The crash has renewed calls for the authorities to enforce traffic rules to reduce deaths and injuries on the country's poorly-maintained road networks.
""We've been speaking to the local assembly to fix rumble strips on the road but they said this is a highway so it's not possible,"" said local resident Gifty Mintah. Rumble strips are a noise-making safety feature that alerts drivers when their cars are at the edge of the road.
""But people keep dying and for how long are we going to look on for people to keep dying?""
Crashes are common on highways in Ghana because of poor maintenance, disregard of traffic regulations and unroadworthy vehicles.
An average of six people die on the roads every day, according to the Motor Transport and Traffic Directorate (MTTD) of Ghana police.
In February 2016, 70 people were killed and 13 injured when two buses collided in the same town of Kintampo.
In July 2017, players from one of Ghana's leading football clubs, Asante Kotoko, were victims of a crash in which their team bus rammed into the back of a stationary truck.

In Manikganj, a bus went on the wrong side of Dhaka-Aricha highway and hit a motorcycle near Dhulondi Road Divider area of Ghior upazila around 8:00pm on Monday.

https://www.thedailystar.net/news/frontpage/road-safety-demo-not-much-has-changed-those-2-deaths-1626001,"Aug 29, 2018",Month Since July 29 Deaths: Roads not any safer,"It has been exactly a month since two college students were squashed to death by a bus on the Airport Road that sparked an unprecedented movement by students to demand road safety.
The memories of the tumultuous days have hardly waned and the roads have returned to their old self -- unfit buses still plying, drivers sitting behind steering wheels without licence, and more than 300 road deaths have been added to the total tally in the last one month.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
One of the major reasons for the anarchy on the roads is that the drivers run the buses by paying a certain amount to the owners and so they race through the roads to make as many trips as possible, stopping anywhere on the road to pick that extra passengers. This has not changed although the bus owners made a false promise that they would scrap the system and give appointment letters to the drivers and helpers.
Some things have changed though -- the amount of illegal payment for getting fitness certificates for vehicles. A Dhaka car owner who did not want to be named said she had to pay Tk 5,000 this time, instead of the previous year's Tk 1,500, to get the fitness certificate. The inspectors said her car's tyre size was different from what was mentioned in the papers and that it had a dent on the rear dampener.  
The other change that has come is the cabinet's approval of the draft Road Transport Act 2018 -- something touted by the government as a big deal which it is not since there is no dearth of existing laws to check errant drivers and vehicles. What was lacking is the truthful application of the rules and laws.
The Road Transport Advisory Council headed by the road transport minister held its first meeting after ten months and came up with the age-old decision of stopping low-speed vehicles on highways.
That decision again proved to be on papers as in the past nine days (August 20 to 28) at least 10 accidents happened on highways involving slow vehicles, killing at least 46 people and injuring more than 40 (according to The Daily Star tally alone).
But what has not happened is what many thought the government would do -- form a high-powered taskforce comprising accident experts and examine the root causes for accidents and then set priority to fix the problems.
The adhocism and face-saving measures that the authorities are taking as eyewash can be found in the action of the police on the Natore highway where 15 passengers of a low-speed vehicle died three days ago. Soon after the accident, police forced all such vehicles off that highway.
Elsewhere in the country, these accident-prone transports ply as freely as before.
Apparently disappointed over the failure of the road transport and bridges ministry to ensure road safety and bring discipline in the transport sector, the Prime Minister's Office itself got involved in the process. It has already given directives thrice and formed a high-powered committee headed by PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hassan to monitor implementation of various government measures to ensure road safety.
But even in this volatile situation, transport owners and workers -- very powerful elements in the transport sector often backed by two ministers -- are doing everything to protect their interests. On the pretext of shortage of drivers, they forced the government to relax until December 31 the requirement of experience for getting licences to drive medium and heavy vehicles. This will make the road risker.
According to the National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways, at least 315 people -- 282 men, 39 women and 54 children -- lost their lives in 282 road accidents across the country between July 29 and August 27. At least 819 more were injured.
The non-government platform, which campaigns for transport safety, compiled the data from 22 national dailies, 10 regional dailies and eight news portals and agencies.  
But whatever little changes are happening, it is because of the student protesters, said one BRTA official.
“They gave us a jolt, which was necessary. Now, let's see what happens in the coming days,” he added, asking not to be named.  
Jahangir Fakir, father of Dia Khanam Mim, one of the two college students killed in the July 29 road crash, said it was heartening to see that the government was taking some initiatives, including the drive against unfit vehicles.
“I hope that the government will not go soft. People have started to obey traffic rules, at least to some extent. However, it will take time and I hope discipline will be restored on the road,” he told The Daily Star last night. 
“I want roads to be safe, even if it comes at the cost of my daughter's life,” said Jahangir, himself a bus driver for about 30 years.  ",Dailystar

Take for example the road crash that took place in Narayanganj's Sonargaon upazila on February 26.
A bus driver was talking over phone and arguing with passengers as he was recklessly driving the vehicle on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway after hitting a rickshaw.
Within a short while, the Chittagong-bound bus from Dhaka hit a parked lorry after overtaking a microbus, killing 10 people and injuring at least 25, all bus passengers.
The body and chassis of the bus were widened changing the specifications provided by the manufacturer. Its fitness certificate and tax token had expired around three years ago.
A report of a probe committee commissioned by Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) revealed the fact.
It is a glaring example why and how the accidents, around 3,000 every year, have been taking place in Bangladesh, claiming thousands of lives and dealing a blow to the economy (Tk 40,000 crore annually).
Causes of most the accidents are almost similar -- reckless driving, over-speeding, operating unfit vehicles and dangerous overtaking.
Analysing the police data on road accidents in around the last 15 years, the Buet's Accident Research Institute found that 47 percent accidents took place due to careless driving; 37 percent for over-speeding and 16 percent for other reasons.
According to a police report, 2,513 people were killed and 1,898 injured in 2,562 road accidents last year.
However, road safety campaigners and experts put the number higher because police count the deaths only when cases are filed.
According to Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, 7,397 people were killed and 16,193 injured in 4,979 road accidents last year.
NARAYANGANJ ACCIDENT
Following an order of the Road Transport and Highways Division, a four-member probe committee, led by the BRTA director (road safety), was formed on April 27.
The committee visited the spot, talked to witnesses and passengers and came to know that the bus, MD Yasin (Dhaka Metro-Ba-14-0826), hit a rickshaw near Madanpur Chowrastha on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway and started driving recklessly.
Driver Shipon engaged into an altercation with some passengers as he was talking over phone while driving. He hit a parked lorry after overtaking a microbus in Tipurdi area. The fitness and tax documents of the lorry (Dhaka Metro-Ta-81-0279) had expired too.
After the accident, the driver managed to flee the scene. He has been on the run since then.
As per the registration certificate of the bus, its wheelbase (the distance between the centres of the front and rear wheels) was supposed to be 8,500 millimetre long and it should have 41 seats. But the probe committee found the wheelbase was 8,960 millimetre long and it had 48 seats.
Chassis of the bus was widened by around four feet. Its fitness certificate had expired on May 10, 2015 and the tax token on June 26 that year. The probe committee did not find any document about the vehicle's route permit.
The probe identified reckless driving and illegal overtaking of the bus driver as the main cause of the accident.
It also found plying of rickshaws on the highway, driving vehicles without updated documents, illegal parking of the lorry and changes to the bus' body and chassis as circumstantial causes of the accident.
A day after the accident, a case was filed against the bus driver with Sonargaon Police Station. Later, the case was transferred to Kanchpur Highway Police Station as the accident spot falls under its purview. The BRTA suspended registrations of both the vehicles as they didn't have updated documents.
The probe committee on March 7 sent its report to the road transport ministry with several recommendations, including taking legal actions against the bus driver and owner, said Mahbub-E-Rabbani, director (road safety) of BRTA and also the head of the probe body.
The ministry on April 3 asked the BRTA to take tough actions against the bus driver and owner, said Kamrul Ahsan, joint secretary of the ministry.
He said they asked the BRTA to cancel the registration of the bus, file a case against the bus owner and the workshop concerned for widening the chassis and initiate criminal proceedings against the driver for driving the bus without a valid fitness certificate.
Talking to The Daily Star, Kayum Ali Sarder, officer-in-charge of Kanchpur Highway Police Station, said they verified the ownership of the bus with the BRTA. Police were investigating to find the original owner of the bus as its ownership changed, he added.
The BRTA probe committee said as per the registration certificate, Uttara Finance and Investment Limited is the owner of the bus.
The current owner of the bus is one Parvin Begum of Narayanganj's Siddhirganj. She paid all the installments of money as per the lease agreement with Uttara Finance, said the probe report.
However, Parvin didn't complete the procedure to change the ownership of the bus, it added.
OC Kayum said Parvin, claiming herself to be the owner of the bus, filed a prayer with a Narayanganj court seeking custody of the vehicle and the court ordered police to verify her claim.
Parvin told police that Shipon was driving the bus when the accident took place, the police official mentioned.
As per the probe report, Shipon is from Paschim Laxmipur village in Laxmipur.
The OC said Parvin took away the bus from police last month following the court's order in this regard.
He said they would submit the report, either the charge sheet or the final report, in the accident case once the probe is completed.
BLAME GAME
A 13 kilometre stretch of Dhaka-Chittagong highway, stretching from Kanchpur to Meghna Bridge, falls under the purview of Kanchpur Highway Police Station. The unfit bus ran on the route for around three years before the accident.
Asked why the police didn't take any action against the bus, OC Kayum said they have no permanent check post in the area and the temporary ones are set up upon directives from the higher authorities.
He said it was the duty of BRTA to take action against the bus operator as it gives fitness clearance certificates.
But a BRTA official said they cancelled the registration of the bus in line with the ministry's directives and cases were filed against the driver, bus owner and workshop owner.
It was the highway police who should have taken action against the “unfit bus” because the BRTA has very little to do if any vehicle don't take annual fitness certificate, he said requesting anonymity.
The official said around 10 lakh vehicles are supposed to obtain fitness clearance certificates annually, but on average around 6.5 lakh do so.
So it is the responsibility of the highway police to trace violators of rules and take action against them, he added.

At least 339 people were killed while 1,265 injured in 277 road accidents in 13 days during the Eid journeys this year, indicating that on an average 26 people were killed per day, according to Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
Fifty-two people were killed on roads on June 23 alone, the highest casualty in a single day in recent times.
A total of 274 people were killed and 848 injured in road crashes last year, up from 186 killed and 786 injured in 2016, the organisation said.
Besides, at least 25 people died and 55 others went missing in 18 accidents in waterways while 41 were killed either in train crashes, being hit by trains or falling from trains' rooftops in between June 11 and 23, it added.
The Samity prepared the statistics on the basis of reports of national and regional newspapers and online news portals, Mozammel Hoque Chowdhury, secretary general of the organisation, said at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity.
Rights activists and road safety campaigners blamed the state's inaction for the “procession of death” on the roads.
“These are not deaths. Clearly these are murders,” rights activist Sultana Kamal said, referring to deaths in road accidents.
REASONS BEHIND DEATH
Mozammel said they have been monitoring road accidents for the last four years as such incidents saw an alarming rise during the Eid rush.
Around 1.15 crore holidaymakers leave Dhaka for their homes ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, according to a recent estimate by the Kalyan Samity.
“Although people's journey home before this year's Eid was a little more comfortable due to active presence of all the agencies concerned, the number of accidents, deaths and damages increased when they were returning to Dhaka due to absence of monitoring,” Mozammel said.
In the wake of scores of deaths on roads, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday issued some directives, including driving-time limitations on drivers of long-haul vehicles, to prevent accidents and casualties.
The “procession of deaths” on roads would stop if the PM's directives could be implemented immediately, Mozammel said.
Buses were involved in 18.89 percent accidents while trucks and covered vans in 16.39 percent, locally made Nasimon, Koriman and battery-run vehicles in 25.28 percent, and motor cycles in 15.28 percent accidents this year, he told reporters.
Mozammel said 34.02 percent accidents occurred due to head-on collisions while 32.72 percent took place as vehicles ran over pedestrians and 13.23 percent happened after drivers lost control at the wheel.
Plying of unfit vehicles, lack of rest for drivers, unskilled drivers and helpers, plying of slow-moving vehicles on highways, reckless driving, poor monitoring and bad road conditions were to be blamed for the accidents, he said.
The organisation also came up with 10 recommendations to prevent road accidents. Those include making National Road Safety Council an effective organisation, providing training to drivers by the government, stopping movement of unfit vehicles, conducting road safety audits regularly, constructing a separate lane for speedy vehicles, and implementing the government ban on three-wheelers and slow-moving vehicles on national highways.
ACCIDENT TURNED 'EPIDEMIC'
Aiyubur Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), said road accidents have turned out to be an “epidemic” in the country.
The tendency to violate law was the key behind road accidents and indiscipline in the transport sector, he said.
Referring to a report of the Buet's Accident Research Institute about the economic loss due to road accidents, Aiyubur said it was not possible to measure the loss in GDP.
“Can you measure the death of [prominent cinematographer and journalist] Mishuk Munier [in road accident] in GDP?” he questioned.
Jyotirmoy Barua, a Supreme Court lawyer working for human rights, said deaths in road accidents were a “man-made disaster”.
People responsible to curb road accidents were not discharging their duties properly, said Jyotirmoy, also the vice-chairman of Road Safety Foundation, an organisation working for safe roads and safe driving.
He said bribing was one of the main reasons behind the mismanagement in the transport sector and also for road accidents. “It is the state which is responsible to protect everyone's life. But the state is failing to do this time and again.”
Sultana Kamal, also former adviser to a caretaker government, said people were “dying untimely due to lack of discipline in the national and personal life”.
It seems people were getting involved in a big competition of violating laws to be gainers, she said.
“The tendency of ignoring law is driven from a basic sense of insecurity. The society, we are living in, is facing huge deficit of insecurity,” she said.
Sultana said she was member of a government committee related to accident, but the committee held only two meetings. “The state didn't try its best to face the matter [road accidents].”
Welcoming the PM's directives to prevent road accidents, the rights activist said she wanted to see whether those people who always remain busy in praising the premier followed her directives properly.",Dailystar

On April 3, Rajib was going to attend his classes by a double-decker bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BTRC). He was standing on the rear gate dangling his right hand outside as the bus was overcrowded.
When the bus got stranded at the Sonargaon crossing near Panthakunja Park, a 'Sajan Paribahan' bus tried to make its way through the narrow space on between the BRTC bus and the footpath. However, Rajib's right hand was pressed in between the two buses and got severed from the elbow.
The organisation came up with an eight-point demand at the press conference, which are:
1. The killers of Rajib should be given capital punishment. A law should be formulated keeping the provision of death for all road accidents.
2. To control over traffic jam and prevent road accidents and to ensure proper passengers service through stopping getting on and off a vehicle indiscriminate.
3. Implement the government-fixed rate of transport fare including 50% fare cut for students in city and intercity public transports. Students should get a 25% fare cut in long route transports.
4. Steps should be taken against ""sitting service"" buses which run under various names.
5. There should be a balance in public transport fare. All vehicles should keep the fare chart and those who collect excessive fare should be punished.
6. BRTA must conduct effective drives on a regular basis to stop anarchy in the public transports. Security for women should be ensured and if any woman gets harassed, punitive action should be taken against the culprits.
7. AC and non-AC bus services should be launched to reduce pressure of private transports.
8. People who suffered in road accidents should be brought under an insurance policy. 
Earlier, a Dhaka court again rejected bail prayers of the drivers of BRTC and Sajan Paribahan buses responsible for the accident.

https://www.thedailystar.net/world/top-5-causes-road-accidents-united-states-us-1478173,"Oct 18, 2017",Top 5 causes of car accidents,"From speeding to not taking due care and attention when weather conditions worsen, there are no end of factors that can seriously increase your risk of a potentially fatal car crash.
The list of the top five causes of accidents on US roads, compiled by lowpriceinsuranceprice.com reads like a condemnation of the digital world. Though we all know that alcohol impairs reaction times and that driving when tired can be a recipe for automotive disaster and on the whole, make an effort to avoid doing either, the most common cause of traffic accidents in the US is distraction.
Distracted driving
Using smartphones while driving, attempting to text and steer, tuning the radio or playing with the infotainment system at an inopportune moment are the leading causes of an accident.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
Just two seconds of inattention while driving can be sufficient to cause an accident. According to the University of Utah, it can take up to 27 seconds to regain one's attention after shifting focus from the road to the infotainment system and back again.
But distractions don't have to be digital. As we spend such a large percentage of our time behind the wheel either traveling to or from work or running family errands, drivers are just as guilty of drinking coffee, applying makeup or facing other occupants to hold a conversation when they should be looking ahead.
NHTSA data suggests that in 2015 alone, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. It also claims that during daylight hours, 660,000 drivers are using their cell phones while behind the wheel.
Driving after drinking
Drunk driving is thankfully on a downward trend yet it is still the second biggest cause of accidents on the road. According to data from 2015, crashes caused by drunk-driving claimed 10,265 lives.
Driving in poor weather conditions
Obviously, you're taking your life in your own hands if you decided to drive into a tornado, but between 2002 and 2012, roughly 1.3 million weather-related vehicle crashes occurred on US roads every year and the majority of them were due to fog, heavy rain, icy or wet road conditions.
Over that period, fog alone was responsible for 31,385 crashes, 511 deaths and 11,812 injuries.
According to the National Weather Service, over the same period of time, extreme heat killed 123 people, tornadoes killed 109, flooding was responsible for 75 lives and lightning for 33. The NHTSA puts environmental elements as the cause of 2% of all crashes on US roads.
Speeding
Speed was a contributing factor in 27% of all fatal crashes in 2015, and it is a persistent problem with speeding-relating accidents remaining stubbornly at the one-third mark of all accidents for the past 20 years. Even though modern cars' braking systems are phenomenal and some vehicles are capable of braking without human intervention, over the same period of time human reaction times and reflexes have not altered.
Mechanical problems
Without tires that grip, steering that steers and brakes that bring a car to a complete halt, it's only a matter of time before you'll be involved in an accident. Even something as seemingly trivial as a worn-out wiper blade could mean the difference between seeing and not seeing an obstacle before it's too late. Worse still, studies show that maintenance is one of the elements of car ownership that drivers tend to put off, either to save money or because they can't be without their car while repairs are being carried out. The NHTSA estimates that between 2004-2007, the last time it gathered in-depth data on the subject, mechanical and other vehicular issues were the overriding cause of 44,000 car accidents or 2% of all crashes recorded over the period studied.",Dailystar

The Tk 27 lakh that he had been carrying with him disappeared.
Though police said Jakir died after an unknown vehicle hit his car near Rajendrapur National Park's Gate No-3 around 11:00pm on Friday, his family members suspect otherwise.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
“At around 8:30pm, my brother left his Uttara home with Tk 27 lakh to give the money to the garment factory owners at Baniar Chala village in Gazipur. He was driving the car. If he died in an accident, the money should have been found on him,” his brother Nasir Uddin told The Daily Star.
The family suspect that he was either killed during a robbery staged as an accident or if there really was an accident, whoever went to the scene first took the money.
Quoting locals, Abdul Hai, officer-in-charge of Salna Highway Police Station, said Jakir's car skidded off the road and flipped over after an unknown vehicle hit it.
He was rushed to Shaheen Tajuddin Ahmed Medical College where doctors declared him dead.
The victim's nephew, Sagar Mia, told The Daily Star that they came know about the “accident” over phone from one Belayat, who had a business rivalry with Jakir for a long time, thus raising suspicion about the incident.
Belayet is an inhabitant of their village Baniar Chala, located around 7km away from the spot.
Contacted, Belayet told The Daily Star that one Rashidul form Rajendrapur area informed him over the phone about the incident.
“Knowing details about the car and from a business card with a mobile phone number, I thought that the victim was Jakir. So I informed his family.”
When asked why Rashidul had called him, Belayet said he did not know and that he could not remember who Rashidul was and that he could be an acquaintance.
He, however, denied having any business rivalry with Jakir and said they had not been in touch for about eight years. 
Hearing the news, police from Salna Highway Police Station and Hotapara Police Outpost, under Joydevpur Police Station, and firemen from Shreepur Fire Station went to the spot.
Officer-in-Charge Abdul Hai of the highway police station said police from the outpost first reached the spot while Nazmul Ahsan, in-charge of the outpost, said it was the highway police who got there first.
Police could not recover the money.
Jakir's nephew Sagar also alleged that the outpost in-charge Nazmul had detained his father Nasir Uddin and his car two to three months ago and threatened to implicate him in a narcotics case.
Police released his father and the car after taking Tk 6.5 lakh in bribe and Belayet mediated the negotiations, he claimed.
Nazmul denied the allegations.
Mohammad Jihad, station officer of Shreepur Fire Station, said police had taken the victim to the hospital before firemen reached the spot. He said he overheard relatives asking about the missing money.",Dailystar

The National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), an NGO that advocates for safe streets, revealed the half-yearly numbers while releasing its regular monthly survey and observation report on road accidents in Bangladesh.
The report was prepared from perusal of 22 national dailies, 10 regional newspapers and eight online news portals and news agencies - hence it is important to note they only take into account accidents that get reported.
The NCPSRR report's findings mean although both the rate of fatalities and incidence of accidents have gone up significantly, the growth in the former has far outpaced the latter.
According to the National Committee's report, 333 people, including 34 women and 42 children, lost lives and 632 others received injuries in 265 mishaps in the last month (June).
Among the deceased a total of 120 people, including 11 women and 15 children, were killed and 226 others injured in between June 23 and 30 during the 8-day Eid holidays.

https://www.thedailystar.net/editorial/roads-death-1426012,"Jun 30, 2017",Roads of death!,"Eid holidays inevitably bring us both joy and sorrow. Sorrow because there are so many road accidents taking away precious lives. We know that at least 41 people were killed on the roads between last Sunday and Wednesday. Invariably these are caused by speeding, reckless overtaking and drivers not caring too hoots about safety of passengers. Last Eid, there were 52 dead in five days during Eid holidays and newspaper reports show that some 1,215 people lost their lives over the last 135 days in various districts. Yes, we understand that traffic is particularly heavy during these holidays, but the death toll keeps rising and one tends to think that no matter what the casualty figures are or how many people are maimed, they are acceptable losses to authorities who refuse to take measures to reduce traffic fatalities.
And what of those who are injured and particularly those maimed permanently? What about their loss of a livelihood or the emotional scar of having lost the use of limbs? Who picks up the cost of injury due to the recklessness of drivers of vehicles? Given the culture of impunity these drivers apparently enjoy, how exactly will things improve and we no longer have to write about gruesome deaths and injury every Eid?

Although much hope was pinned on the draft Road Transport Act 2017, we were taken aback to see it lacking any provision for punishment for fatal accidents or accidents that cause injuries. Also, the fact that these offences remain bailable, make it easy for offenders to keep doing the same over and over again.

The victims were travelling on the truck and it appears that they died after cement sacks fell on them, said Rezaul Karim, officer-in-charge of Pirganj Police Station. Eight others were also injured.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
The tragic accident took place around 5.45am on the Dhaka-Rangpur highway near Kalabagan village just two days before the festival.
Most of the deceased were garment workers. They were heading for their homes in Kaliganj and Aditmari upazilas of Lalmonirhat from Gazipur, said the OC.
The dead were identified as Rabiul Islam, 40, Azizul Islam, 35, Suporna Begum, 10, Kohinur Begum, 30, Jhantu Mia, 35, Moznu Mia 29, Nasida Akter, 40, Alamgir Hossain 27, Delwar Hossain 25, Jashim Uddin 26, Anisuzzaman, 35, Shahiduzzaman 30, Saddam Hossain 24, Munir Hossain 24, RafiqulIslam, 24, and Khalil Mia 32.
The injured were being treated at Rangpur Medical College Hospital (RMCH), said its director Moudud Ahmed.
Failing to get seats in already overcrowded buses and trains during every Eid rush, many holidaymakers, especially those from the low income group, travel on trucks, although there is a government ban on the movement of the vehicle on high ways for three days before and after the festival.
According to a government-supervised survey, on average, 64 people die every day from injuries suffered in traffic accidents in Bangladesh.
Sometimes, the number of the accidents increases during the Eid journeys when a huge number of people and unfit vehicles hit the highways.
On February 3 this year, a truck driven by a driver's helper lost control and ploughed through a crowd gathered to attend a funeral of a Buddhist monk in Rangamati, killing eight people.
YESTERDAY'S ACCIDENT
Khadiza Begum, a survivor of yesterday's accident, said some 40 people, including her husband Alamgir Hossain and brother Delwar Hossain, seven to nine other women, and a child, boarded the truck in Gazipur on Friday evening.
“We got onto the truck as we failed to get bus tickets,” she told this correspondent over phone lying on a bed at the RMCH.
The vehicle was already loaded with cement sacks and each of the Eid holidaymakers paid the driver and the helper Tk 400 for their trip to Lalmonirhat.
Minutes before the accident, the helper, in his early 20s, took the wheel and the driver went to the next seat to have a nap, said the woman, who was yet to be told that her husband and brother were already dead.
Alamgir's cousins Saddam and Munir Hossain were also among the deceased.
All of a sudden, the truck overturned, leaving us baffled, she said.
The driver and the helper fled.
Witness Razu Mia, who runs a roadside shop, said the truck flipped and those on it were buried under the cement sacks. Many, however, jumped and escaped unhurt, he said.
Locals, fire fighters and law enforcers rushed to the spot and found 11 people dead on the spot. Thirteen injured were taken to Pirganj Upazila Health Complex where five died, said police.
Later, the health complex authorities referred the injured to the RMCH.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Wahiduzzaman, deputy commissioner of Rangpur, formed a three member committee headed by Abdul Kuddus, assistant director of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority in the district, to investigate the incident.
Visiting the spot, the DC announced that each of the family of the deceased would be given Tk 20,000.
Rangpur police also formed a 3-member committee led by Additional SP Shahidul Islam to probe the matter.
Contacted, Rezaul Karim, OC of Pirganj Police Station, said they were trying to arrest the driver and his helper.",Dailystar

Then the air of festivity changed into mourning as her grandmother Aklima Begum and neighbours began wailing on receiving the news of death of 16 people, of the union, in a road accident early yesterday. Two of the victims were Aklima's two sons including Sharmin's father Saddam Islam.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
Sharmin might not have realised what she had lost, but she burst into tears watching elders mourn and cry.    
“My father told me he had bought new clothes for me. He told me I would wear the new clothes during Eid,” said Sharmin, only daughter of Saddam, at her home in Latabar village. 
Thirty-five people, mostly low-income people and day labourers, from three villages -- Batrish Hazari, Latabar and Balapara -- of the union in Kaliganj upazila of Lalmonirhat met one of the worst road accidents in recent times as they were going home on a cement-laden truck.
The truck skidded off the Dhaka-Rangpur highway at Pirganj of Rangpur around 4:30am, leaving 11 people dead on the spot and 13 others injured, said Rezaul Karim, officer-in-charge of Pirganj Police Station. Later, five others succumbed to injuries.
 All the victims used to work in Gazipur.
Jahangir Alam, Union Parishad chairman of Chandrapur, said death of so many people from the same union took away the joy of celebrating Eid.
“Those, who were lucky, who escaped death, told me the accident took place because the driver was driving with sleepy eyes.”
The truck driver, Nazim Uddin, who also hails from the same union, managed to flee after the accident.
Meanwhile, at her home, Aklima, 46, was passing out, as she learnt her two sons -- Saddam, 28, and Alamgir Hossain, 25, would never return to her.
“Our sons told me they were coming home and they would bring clothes as Eid gifts. Now, forget clothes, my sons are no more,” Aklima cried out. Her daughters-in-law -- Sharifa Begum and Khadiza Begum -- survived the accident luckily.
Like Aklima, Mizanur Rahman and Mahfuza Begum of Batrish Hazari village, were grieving as their son Maznu Miah, 22, was killed in the accident.
“I talked to Maznu over the phone at around 11:00pm on Friday. He told me he would have sehri with us,” Mizanur said.
Maznu, who had been working at a garment factory in Dhaka since 2010, had a plan to buy a piece of land with his savings after Eid.
“Now, everything is over,” Mizanur said.
“Of our two sons, the elder one lives separately. We were dependent on Maznu,” said Maznu's mother Mahfuza Begum.
“We didn't lose our son only, but also our dream, hope, shelter. We don't know how to survive without our son Maznu,” she sobbed.
Rubel Islam, 28, of Batrish Hazari village, also saw his hope and dreams shattered after losing his father  Kohinur Islam, 48, to the accident.
His father had wanted to return to the village, leaving his job in a garment factory, to open a grocery shop.
""Today, he is no more,” he said, “And my mother is injured. I don't know what is in her fate as she is in a critical condition,” said Rubel with tears.
Contacted, truck owner Abdul Karim of Chandrapur said the truck driver was responsible for the accident. “I didn't permit him to carry passengers.”",Dailystar

Four people from Mumbai, the financial hub of India, have come to the rescue of victim Mohammed Kamruzzaman who needs the blood for an urgent surgery to treat multiple fractures, The Times of India reported.
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
The blood reached Apollo Hospitals in Dhaka and the patient would receive his first pint of blood today and is expected to have a surgery tomorrow, Akter Jamil Ahmed, deputy general manager of the hospital, told The Daily Star.
Kamruzzaman, 25, had met with an accident in Dhaka on May 21 and was taken to the hospital. Doctors discovered that his blood group was incompatible with most common types, the newspaper said.
On further investigation, they found he had the rare Bombay blood group that even leading blood banks in Bangladesh were unaware of. In India, where a robust blood distribution network exists, less than 400 people are known to have the Bombay blood group, a few of whom were traceable donors.
A frantic online and offline search led Kamruzzaman's colleagues and the Arinoba Plastic Industries Ltd, the company he works for, to Vinay Shetty of the Mumbai-based NGO Think Foundation.
SK Tuhinur Alam, one of Kamruzzaman's colleagues, brought the blood from Mumbai around 11:50am yesterday. He went to Mumbai on Thursday to collect the blood donated by Swapna Sawant, Krishnanand Kori, Mehul Bhelekar and Pravin Shinde.
Talking to The Daily Star last night, he said he handed over the blood to the hospital authorities around 12:30pm.
Tuhin, also a director of Arinoba, said they tried to find a match in some 50 donors in Bangladesh, and had spent around Tk 1.5 lakh for the cross-matching.
All their efforts went in vain.
He said their company had already spent around Tk 12 lakh for Kamruzzaman's treatment and would stand beside him.
“We are very thankful to Mr Shetty. We are indebted to him forever,” Tuhin added.
On Friday, Tuhin told The Times of India, “We had given up hope that he will live. The bones of his left leg and hand are shattered. His pelvis is broken too. Doctors told us that only surgery could guarantee his complete recovery.”
“We searched up and down the city [Dhaka] and called up uncountable number of hospitals and blood banks, but most had never heard of this blood group. The hospital decided to test his family members and found his sister having the same group. But she was not fit to donate. Our employer, Arinoba Plastic Industries, facilitated this inter-country coordination after learning that Kamruzzaman was the main breadwinner of the family and his ailing mother's treatment was dependent on his earnings. In a way, India is not saving just one life, but an entire family,” he said.
It had been an uphill task for Think Foundation to get multiple authorities to allow the export of blood, which is only permitted under special circumstances.
“We had to seek permissions as export is permitted only under licence. We got approvals from the State Blood Transfusion Council, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Directorate of Health Services and Central Industrial Security Force,” The Times of India quoted Shetty as saying.
The blood was transported in a special plastic box with ice gel packs. “Blood has a long shelf life, of about six weeks. Temperature control is the key,” he added.

A survivor of the coach said the passengers sensed the danger right after the helper took the steering wheel in Bogra around 5:00am and the driver went to the back to sleep.
""As the helper took the steering, many passengers protested,"" said Sadikul Islam, the survivor. The coach was at speed with 40 to 50 passengers inside and around 30 more on its roof, he told The Daily Star over the phone.
Some of the passengers, however, got down in Bogra and Rangpur.
The passengers started to panic seeing the reckless driving and warned the helper repeatedly, he said.
""But the warnings fell on deaf ears and rather he sped up and started overtaking many vehicles,"" said Sadikul, who was returning from Comilla.
He said at one stage some passengers even asked him to stop the vehicle so that they could get off and asked to see his licence.

""Just before the crash, it felt like the bus was moving without any balance and suddenly went on the wrong side of the road. We heard the bus coming from opposite direction honking,"" said Sadikul.
""I was like thrown out of the bus from the window,"" he said. He, however, suffered minor injuries.

Getting assurance from the local administration of exemplary punishment for the culprits, they withdrew the blockade, reports our Rangpur correspondent.
Most drivers are least bothered about safety and they drive recklessly without almost any intervention from law enforcers on the highways.
The authorities' reluctance to punish unruly drivers, helpers and vehicle owners help recurrence of fatal road crashes in regular intervals.
There is only one instance in which a driver was punished for reckless driving and killing people.
According to World Health Organisation, more than 21,000 people die a year on the roads of Bangladesh, which takes a heavy toll on victims' families and the country's economy.
There are a number of high court directives to improve road safety but no significant improvement in road-fatality statistics has been observed.
In 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011–2020) with a goal to stabilise and reduce predicted levels of road traffic fatalities around the world.

Nobody has an answer to this plea of Shahjalal Bari Purno, aged only two years and a month.   
To soothe the little boy, his aunt Sabina Yasmin carried him in her arms and walked from the corridor to the nurses' station of the hospital where he was undergoing treatment. 
Sometimes, she managed to hush him by feeding juice. Sometimes, she did it by showing him the world outside through the window of his cabin on the seventh floor of the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital.
""How long can I keep him quiet this way?"" said his aunt as the kid starts crying again after momentary pauses and demands to go to his parents.  
Purno lost his father, mother and a sister in the early hours of Tuesday, when a long-haul bus and their car collided head-on in the early hours of Tuesday.
The accident took place at Daudkandi on Dhaka-Chittagong highway on their way back to the capital from the wedding of a relative in Comilla.
Four died on the spot -- his father Fazlul Bari Mithu, 40, associate professor and registrar of National Institute of Mental Health and Research; mother Asmaul Housna, 34; sister Fahmida Fairooz Sneha, 11; and house help Sima, 21.

""What can I say to this little kid?"" said the aunt when one of these reporters talked to her at the hospital yesterday.
However, she thinks Purno's condition might improve a bit when he sees his sister Faiza, who was on her way to Dhaka for further check-up.
Faiza, who was under care of her youngest aunt Nahida Yasmin Shampa, has yet to realise that her parents are gone forever.
Whenever she enquires about her parents, her relatives say her father is busy at his hospital in Dhaka and her mother is there too. Both would come home soon.
Her father used to stay in a quarter of the hospital during the work days.
Before Faiza left Bogra for the capital yesterday afternoon, our correspondent saw her playing with toys in the bedroom of her parents with one of her cousins.
After a while, she asked aunt Shampa, ""Where is my mamoni [mother]?""
Faiza's relatives said doctors found some problems in her lungs. And they sent her to the hospital where Purno was admitted to.
Mahfuzur Rahman, a maternal uncle of Faiza's father, said that upon release, both the kids will stay at Sabina's house in Dhaka for a couple of months as they will need follow-up treatments.
Then their responsibility will be given to Shampa.
Shampa, who lives in Uttara with her husband and only son, has decided to move to Bogra to raise Purno and Faiza, according to Mahfuz and Sabina.

The Airport Road had by then a significant flow of traffic, but no one stopped and came to rescue the man, aged around 35. Some cars slowed down a bit just to avoid hitting the man and his motorbike. Some vehicles even honked for the youth to move off the road.
I stopped my car near the spot. My driving instructor quickly got down and picked up the man onto our car. The man badly grazed his left side and he was bleeding from his hands, waist and legs.
Lying in the backseat – unable to move – he sobbed: “I was lying there and seeking help for quite some time, but no one stopped. No one cared at all!”
I sped up to take him to a hospital as fast as I could. I heard the man muttering something about how he was ignored by the passing vehicles.
While dropping the man – who lives in Dhanmondi – at Metropolitan Hospital in Mohakhali, I was relieved to see the medical staff rushing towards us with a stretcher.
As the faces that peeped through the windows of the passing cars came to my mind, I wondered how these people could act so stone-heartedly even after seeing a man lying in such a bad shape. How could we lose sympathy?
As I was writing this, I happened to notice someone's Facebook post about how a man bled to death in his car as three famous hospitals in Gulshan declined to treat the injured person.
As Saif Kamal came out of Banani Road No 23 at 8:26pm Thursday, he saw a man trying to get on a bus that had just started moving at a green signal. The man, who happened to be the helper of the bus, slipped and was run over by the running bus.
Saif, founder of Toru – an innovation hub that works with youths to transform innovations to social enterprises – stopped his car ignoring the stream of traffic behind him and ran to the injured man.
“A bus was approaching us from the left. I pull his hands to save it from being run over. People on the walkway were looking on. As I began screaming for help, they stopped traffic. I rushed to get water from my car.”
The lower part of the man's body was squashed. “There was no blood, just a white mass. I had never seen human flesh this close.”
A pedestrian helped Saif to take the victim to his car. They rushed to a reputed private hospital at Gulshan-2 intersection, which declined to treat the man. He then drove to another hospital in the area. The security men drove them away saying they could not treat him either.
Worried at the worsening condition of the man, Saif then drove to another hospital. “The doctor was standing casually at the emergency door waiting for hospital staff to pull the person out of the car. I lost my head and screamed at him. He then came and checked the patient, who was still alive and gasping. But the doctor refused to treat him.”
As the doctor advised him to take the man to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Saif asked why they won't treat him.
“I will give you the money but please help. He will die by the time I get him there. There is heavy traffic on the road,” Saif told him. But the doctor remained unmoved.
When he requested the hospital authorities for an ambulance, they refused that too and asked him to get his car off their parking lot.
Frustrated, Saif later headed to the Gulshan Police Station, from where a sub-inspector accompanied him to Kurmitola Hospital.
The first question the SI asked Saif after boarding his car was where he hit the guy. “I explained to him the whole situation. The ride to the hospital was an interrogation session. But the policeman was finally convinced.”
They reached the hospital at 9:45pm.  But the doctor declared the man dead.
“I had to wait for the next two hours while they traced down his kin. His name was Arafat.”
Saif later had to go to Banani Police Station to file a case.
The SI who accompanied him to Kurmitola Hospital advised him not to pick up such victims in his own car. “Police, in many cases, will take it for granted that you ran over the victim,” the SI said.
“It seemed to me that people in the cars do not have empathy for people. While they screamed at me, the pedestrians and poorer ones came to help. What will we do with this so-called education and social status?” Saif wrote. ",Dailystar

Bangladesh Passengers' Welfare Association revealed these in a report at a press conference at the Jatiya Press Club yesterday. The report was prepared on the basis of news published in 10 national and six local dailies.
""As many as 6,581 road crashes were reported in the newspapers ... [But] around 40 percent of the total accidents don't get media coverage at all, according to our assessment,"" said Mozammel Hoque Chowdhury, secretary general of the non-government platform.
Of the accidents, 56 percent took place on the highways, 23 percent in urban areas and 21 percent in rural area, the report says.
Around 60 percent of the victims, who were killed in urban areas, were pedestrians.
It also claims that around 3 lakh unfit vehicles and 10 lakh locally made three-wheelers like Nasiman, Kariman, Bhatbhati and easy-bikes, all illegal, were mainly responsible for the road accidents.
Overtaking, exceeding speed limits, overloading, disregarding traffic rules, engineering faults in road constructions, reckless driving, using headphones while driving and consuming drugs before driving were also held responsible for the accidents.
The association also came up with a set of recommendations to curb road accidents.
The suggestions include utilising the media for raising public awareness about traffic rules, removing makeshift kitchen markets and shops located close to highways, providing professional training to drivers, and strengthening law enforcement to stop unfit vehicles from plying the roads and highways.
The report also recommends that separate lanes be constructed for slow-moving vehicles on highways and trauma centres be set up near highways to provide immediate care to accident victims.",Dailystar

The other road crash victims are: passengers of four-wheeled cars and light vehicles (28 percent), drivers of four-wheeled cars and light vehicles (13 percetn), riders of motorised two or three-wheelers (11 percent), drivers or passengers of buses (8 percent), drivers or passengers of heavy trucks (6 percent) and cyclists (2 percent), according to a WHO annual report.

“Road traffic fatalities take an unacceptable toll – particularly on poor people in poor countries,” said Dr Margaret Chan, director general of WHO, in a press release. “We’re moving in the right direction.”
The report shows that road safety strategies are saving lives. “But it also tells us that the pace of change is too slow.”
Though 79 countries have seen a decrease in the absolute number of fatalities in the last three years, 68 countries have seen an increase.
Countries that have had the most success in reducing the number of road traffic deaths have achieved this by improving legislation, enforcement, and making roads and vehicles safer, the press release said.

Joy we all understand. The horrors came in the form of road deaths. Every day as holidayers returned from home, scores died in road crashes. And this prompted the government to make some insanely funny decisions.
First, it banned movement of slow vehicles like three-wheelers on highways. Later, it allowed them to ply for a small period just to refuel. And then it set a speed limit of 80km per hour on the highways.
Also READ: 80km the max

In my view all these three decisions are ill-conceived, bereft of reality and are bound to fail. Let's examine the facts.

WATCH: CNG autos: A highway threat (video)
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
It is true the slow vehicles, specially the battery-operated three-wheelers, are a real nuisance on the highways. They irritate drivers, pose as barriers on highway driving and are often the subjects of accidents.

Having said, that there is little reason to ban them. I have driven through the highways hundreds of times, getting irritated every time I overtook a slow vehicle. Thousands of drivers take their private cars on the highways every day. Yet I have not heard of a private car hitting a slow vehicle. Why? Because we who drive private cars do it safely and with care. That is what a driver should do while sitting behind the steering wheel.
Then why do the buses hit them so often?
That is because the bus drivers think they are sitting in the cockpit of fighter jets and zoom through the highways at breakneck speed, disregarding any safety rules. The bus drivers not only hit the slow vehicles, they are the real menace for any vehicle for that matter. They are the real culprits for all these deaths on the highways. So why don't we ban buses instead of three-wheelers? Will that be a sane idea? Not at all.
Rescuers stand beside a smashed bus that collided head-on with another bus on Dhaka-Sirajganj highway in Kamarkhand upazila of Sirajganj on July 19. At least 14 people were killed in the road accident. Photo: STAR
Then comes the issue of limiting speed to 80km an hour.

Also READ: Total chaos on highways

Our highways are so crammed that I myself find it difficult to speed beyond 65km. Negotiating these roads at 80km is very risky. What our bus drivers do, they speed through crammed roads at 80km or even beyond that speed. The result is obvious: accidents.
In the past the government had wanted to install 'governor seals' in buses to limit speed but the move failed. This time the same initiative is bound to fail as reckless bus drivers will tamper with the seal, if it is at all installed. And the question will remain about who will monitor the speed and whether we have that capability.

But more than that it is the reckless behavior of the bus drivers that causes the accidents. I have often seen them zooming through two vehicles with barely any safety room. They overtake when it seems an insane and impossible act. They violate each and every traffic rule. And why not? There is no enforcement of law to catch them. They stop their vehicle any place at will, blocking the entire highway in front of traffic police. I cannot remember killer bus drivers being punished. And they have their all-powerful unions to protest any action.

Such a view was expressed at a seminar organised by National Unity for Prevention of Road Accidents on Saturday. The instant reaction of the public is demonstrated after every such accident that cost more than a dozen lives daily. And the public vents its anger by blocking roads or damaging vehicles, because of the repetitive manner of these accidents, and the apparent impunity of the errant drivers. It is true though that the civil society is seen to be more voluble when the unfortunate victim or victims happen to be influential person/s. 
The issue of road accidents and prevention cannot be over emphasised. While public awareness is an essential part of the exercise to reduce road accidents, we feel that the other two stakeholders -- the law enforcing agencies and the private bus owners and drivers, have an equally, if not more, important role in this regard.

When one talks of giving driving license only to trained persons it becomes the responsibility of the owners on the one hand to see that only qualified persons are employed as drivers, and the responsibility of the police on the other, to ensure that fit and competent persons only are allowed to take the wheels of a vehicle. And here not only the awareness of the public but the awareness of the employers and owners should also be honed.

After colliding with the tree, the bus plunged into a ditch. Going by what data has been compiled by this newspaper since January, 2015 based on reports, there have been 396 confirmed deaths and the number of injured stands at three short of the 700 mark. These are not mere samples on a database, rather they are or were people who have either been killed or maimed in various ways. They were unfortunate enough to be passengers on vehicles that ply in their thousands on our 
unsafe highways.
The response to this incident as has been the standard response to the dozens of incidents in the recent past is the promise for action. This usually constitutes the formation of a ""high level committee"" that will make a probe of the incident and submit its findings to relevant authorities for further action. That bus drivers routinely drive recklessly often without licenses where the buses themselves often lack fitness certificates has become a common affair. It is also ""usual"" for many of our highways have neither divider nor speed breakers at crucial, accident-prone locations. Are we to assume then that human life is cheap in Bangladesh? We do not think so. Our hearts go out to those who are no longer with us because of manmade errors, errors that are rectifiable but those who have the power to do something choose to look the other way.

https://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/grief-over-easy-75027,"Apr 2, 2015","Grief, Over Easy","WE see a continuous display of grief and sorrow in the media—bodies lined up after car crashes, young boys and girls with their faces charred by Molotov cocktails.  
Like a slideshow, these images appear between commercials and family drama serials, news of important people addressing meetings and round-the-clock, inexplicable dancing and singing on the Indian TV channels.  
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
It's hard to grasp all this sadness. When it is shown for public consumption, we should know what to make of it, what to do with it, what it is good for. Is it shown to create empathy for the victims? If that's the case, is it working?
When we see a bad guy on TV, our first reaction is: Lock him up. When we see a hero, we think: Praise him, give him medals.  When we see a war—as the Iraq War wrongfully started by Bush or the Israeli war machine unleashing massive firepower on Palestinian civilians—we understand that we are not in favour of that war. 
But grief is different. When we see images of family members gathering around the dead bodies of their loved ones and wailing, we are like children watching grown-ups in despair. We know something has gone terribly wrong, but we do not know what to do. We are helpless, helplessly watching. We cannot know grief for someone else, we can only recognise it. 
Television channels and newspapers appear to deal with sorrow, personal loss, agony and suffering. But they are not our sufferings. We do not care about someone else's child being killed in a car crash or someone else's daughter being raped.  We just manage the automatic reflex of a slice of grimace, letting out a glint of a sigh. Then we go back to doing whatever we were doing. 
And since we do not care, all these people are turned into characters from a piece of fiction, or a film. They may suffer for themselves but for us they become entertainment. Bad news dominates the headlines.  
Grief is not cheap. Grief is loss, permanent loss. What we see on screen or on the pages of newspapers is not loss. They are simulations of loss, at best. They are the pictures of loss broken into flashes of images, like chips of broken glass reflecting off a facet. But it is not the whole. I see the picture of a mother drowned in tears who has just lost her son, or a man who has lost the love of his life. I cannot know their pain. The picture is all I got—the picture of their pain.  
Television wants us to buy things, including news. We see people who have experienced a deep grief and we buy their suffering, just like we buy a microwave oven or a bottle of anti-septic, advertised for whatever it purports to be. 
On TV, grief has a shelf life. Time to move on. Time to seek closure. We should talk, walk, eat, shop and go on a vacation. Get on with our lives. But we fail to calculate that the pain increases even as we get on with it. Grief comes to us all at once, so we think it will be over all at once. Wrong. It is our guest for a lifetime. There is no real, final closure, no end to the loss. When something wrenching happens to us, trying to find closure would be like willfully blocking our memory, refusing to give it a chance, not to work itself out, but to work itself in the marrow of our memories. 
We see all these images everyday in the morning as soon as we switch on the TV or get the newspaper. We hear their wailing. We hear them cry out to you, to me, in the distance, every morning, every evening. 
But do we really see? Do we listen?
