In reply to another query from the BNP lawmaker, Quader said, “There is a specific format to record road accidents. Police, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, and the Accident Research Institute under BUET are doing the job.”
While detailing on the causes of road accidents, Quader said they usually occur due to lack of awareness among road users.
Unskilled drivers, tendency to violate law, lack of implementation of law, unfit vehicles, tendency to overtake and overload vehicles are some of the main causes, he added.
